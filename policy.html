    <h1>Privacy Policy for PDFMaker</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Replace with date]</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the Android application <strong>PDFMaker</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, “us”)
        handles user data and information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Free and Not for Resale</h2>
    <p>
        PDFMaker is provided as a free application. It is not licensed or intended for resale,
        redistribution, or any commercial resale activity by users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        PDFMaker does <strong>not collect, store, process, or transmit</strong> any personal or
        sensitive user information. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No names, date of birth, phone numbers, or important details are collected.</li>
        <li>No usage analytics, tracking identifiers, or advertising identifiers are collected.</li>
        <li>No device information, location data, or any other technical identifiers are collected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The App operates entirely on the user’s device and does not send user data to external servers
        controlled by the developer.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How the App Works</h2>
    <p>
        PDFMaker generates PDF files based solely on the HTML and CSS content that the user
        inputs or provides to the App. The App:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses only the HTML and CSS content the user types, pastes, or loads within the App.</li>
        <li>Processes that content locally on the device to generate a PDF.</li>
        <li>Does not use the user’s information for any other purpose or activity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any content you provide (HTML, CSS, or generated PDFs) remains under your control on your device.
        The App does not upload, share, or transmit this content to the developer.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Use of User Information for Any Activity</h2>
    <p>
        PDFMaker does not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use user information for advertising or marketing.</li>
        <li>Sell or share user information with third parties.</li>
        <li>Profile users or perform any form of tracking or analytics based on user information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. “AS IS” Disclaimer and User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        PDFMaker is provided on an <strong>“AS IS”</strong> and <strong>“AS AVAILABLE”</strong> basis,
        without any warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the App, you agree that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You use the App at your own risk.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for the content you input (HTML, CSS) and the PDFs generated.</li>
        <li>You bear all consequences arising from using the App, including any loss of data,
            errors in generated PDFs, or any other direct or indirect damages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The developer shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising out of
        or in connection with the use of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        PDFMaker does not directly integrate with third-party analytics, advertising networks, or other
        external services that collect user data. If you choose to share or open generated PDFs using
        other apps or services on your device, their privacy policies and practices will apply.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the App after any changes to this Privacy Policy
        constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
